/**
 * It is similar to String class in Java both are used to create string.
 * StringBuffer class is used to create a mutable string object.
 * It means, it can be changed after it is created. It represents growable and writable character sequence.
 * So StringBuffer class is used when we have to make lots of modifications to our string.
 * It is also thread safe. Multiple threads cannot access it simultaneously
